 1. User Management in Linux

Introduction to User Management in Linux
Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can operate on a system simultaneously. Proper user management ensures security, controlled access, and system integrity.

Key files involved in user management:

/etc/passwd – Stores user account details.
/etc/shadow – Stores encrypted user passwords.
/etc/group – Stores group information.
/etc/gshadow – Stores secure group details.
Creating Users in Linux
To create a new user in Linux, use:

useradd Command (For most Linux distributions)
useradd username
This creates a user without a home directory.

To create a user with a home directory:

useradd -m username
To specify a shell:

useradd -s /bin/bash username
adduser Command (For Debian-based systems)
adduser username
This is an interactive command that asks for a password and additional details.
